Files:
	in.foo - This file.
	i - Compo version.
	i.rel - Release version. Displays author info, no other
		difference.

Requires: 
	_80x50_ Linux text console (don't try xterm or anything like
	that, it won't work)
	OSS-compatible sound (ALSA with OSS-emulation works fine)
	Writeable /tmp (shouldn't leave anything there)

	Precalc may take something like 10-20 seconds, be patient.
